# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis ðŸš²

This project analyzes Chicago's Cyclistic bike-share data (January â€“ July 2025) to understand how casual riders and annual members use bikes differently. The goal is to identify patterns that can inform marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into long-term members.

**Tools & Skills:**  
BigQuery (SQL), Google Sheets, Tableau, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Analytical Thinking

**Key Insights:**  
- Casual riders take longer rides on classic bikes, likely for leisure or sightseeing, while members tend to take shorter rides.  
- Both casual riders and members prefer electric bikes when considering total number of rides.  
- Peak riding hours differ: casual riders are most active in late afternoon and evening, whereas members ride mostly during commuting hours.  
- Weekend usage is slightly higher among casual riders, while members ride more consistently across weekdays.

The full analysis, including data cleaning steps, SQL queries, and visualizations, is available in the [notebook](https://github.com/olesia-hre/cyclistic-bike-analysis/blob/main/cyclistic_bike_share_analysis.ipynb).
